### Maths introduction

- **Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}**
  1. 4+5 = 0
  1. 3x5 = 6

- **For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}**
  1. **Can we consider 'S' and the operation multiplication to be a group ?** Yes
  1. **Can we consider 'S' and the operation division to be a group ?** No, it fails the closure property (3/2 is not in the set) and the inverse element property (the inverse of the numbers are not in the set)
