- **What do you understand by**
  -  **O(n)** : The algorithm's complexity grows linearly in proportion to the input size.
  -  **O(1)** : The algorithm's complexity is constant.
  -  **O(log n)** : The algorithm's complexity grows in proportion to the log of the input size.

- **Which of those is best when describing a proof size ?** O(1), constant size, would be the best.
